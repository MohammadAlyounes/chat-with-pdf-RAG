       "'War at the Speed of Light 183\\nwhich wants to wield military power has to embrace AI with which to enable\\nand augment its armed forces. To do other wise would be like failing to adopt\\ngunpowder, airpower, tanks, or aircraft or perhaps, even more aptly, failing\\nto adopt mapping and charts.\\nYet AI is not miraculous; it is not magic. AI offers novel capabilities, but its\\npotential can be harnessed only through profound organisational reformation.\\nA new relationship between the armed forces and the tech sector is required.\\nConsequently, as armed forces pursue AI, a military- tech complex is\\nappearing. In the next decade, the partnership between the state military\\nforces and the private tech companies is likely to consolidate and deepen.\\nUtopian or dystopian visions of war conducted by supercomputers and killer\\ndrone swarms are phantasmagorical. Nevertheless, an emerging military- tech\\ncomplex transforms the way in which states defend themselves and fight each\\nother. The increasing reliance of the armed forces on the data, the expertise,\\nthe computing power, and the capital of the tech sector has profound implica \\ntions not just for the armed forces but for civil- military relations themselves. It\\nrevises the political settlements which were established between governments,\\nindustry, and the armed forces in the twentieth century. It alters the relation \\nship between the armed forces and the private sector, the relationship between\\nthe armed forces and the state, and the relationship between the armed forces\\nand citizens. It also changes the relationship between rival militaries.\\nA military- tech complex does not change the nature of war, of course.\\nIt may not even revolutionise the character of war; it seems to be affirming\\nonly the current trend towards attritional and positional warfare. In the next\\n decade, warfare is not going to fulfil the fantasies of science- fiction writers.\\nCyborgs will not take over. Supercomputers and killer robots and drones will\\nnot replace humans. Nevertheless, it is imperative that no one be under any\\nillusion. The development of AI and its accompanying military- tech complex\\n will change the armed forces, the way they fight, and their relations to the state\\nand society. We are on the edge of a historic reformation of military affairs.'"
