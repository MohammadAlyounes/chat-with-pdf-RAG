       "'Preface ix\\nempirical and methodological obstacles. Sociology aspires to be generalis \\ning and abstract; it aims to offer not just a narrative history of an event but a\\ntheory of social practice. Nevertheless, the best empirical sociology is almost\\nalways situated in a concrete, definable location; it studies a par tic u lar group of\\n people, in a defined organisation, doing something specific, at an identifiable\\ntime and place. In my work on the armed forces, I have certainly always tried\\nto employ this method. I have studied rapid reaction forces, infantry platoons,\\nand divisional commanders. These actors are all located at specific places; it is\\npos si ble to engage with them directly. As a result, I have often visited infantry\\nbattalions and divisional headquarters.\\nThis AI proj ect has sometimes defied that method. The military develop \\nment of AI is diffuse. It is not located in one military unit, or one headquarters,\\nor even just a few places. Its application is diverse, multiple, and temporary. It\\nis occurring at dif fer ent times and dif fer ent speeds in disparate ele ments of the\\narmed forces. One cannot apprehend its military application without also engag \\ning with tech companies and defence ministries. International and transnational\\nlinkages in the defence and tech sectors have also been significant. The military\\napplication of AI is an ecol ogy, rather than a discrete technology; it is a complex,\\nintangible, half- obscured web of practices and interactions, rather than a single,\\nsolid edifice. It eludes easy investigation and description.\\nSo, AI, Automation, and War is avowedly preliminary; it is merely the\\nbeginning of an investigation into AI and the armed forces. I plan to con \\ntinue to work on AI and, in par tic u lar, to explore a question implied but not\\nfully answered here: how does AI actually influence commanders military\\ndecisions? This book might even be read as an essay, rather than a definitive'"
