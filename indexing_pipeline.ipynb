       "'Preface ix\\nempirical and methodological obstacles. Sociology aspires to be generalis \\ning and abstract; it aims to offer not just a narrative history of an event but a\\ntheory of social practice. Nevertheless, the best empirical sociology is almost\\nalways situated in a concrete, definable location; it studies a par tic u lar group of\\n people, in a defined organisation, doing something specific, at an identifiable\\ntime and place. In my work on the armed forces, I have certainly always tried\\nto employ this method. I have studied rapid reaction forces, infantry platoons,\\nand divisional commanders. These actors are all located at specific places; it is\\npos si ble to engage with them directly. As a result, I have often visited infantry\\nbattalions and divisional headquarters.\\nThis AI proj ect has sometimes defied that method. The military develop \\nment of AI is diffuse. It is not located in one military unit, or one headquarters,\\nor even just a few places. Its application is diverse, multiple, and temporary. It\\nis occurring at dif fer ent times and dif fer ent speeds in disparate ele ments of the\\narmed forces'"
